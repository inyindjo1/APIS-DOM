The QR Code Generator Web App is a lightweight, user-friendly application built to instantly convert any piece of text or URL into a QR code. This project was created as part of a software engineering assignment to showcase modern web development practices, including API integration, event-driven JavaScript, and local data persistence using localStorage.

The core idea is to provide users with a fast and accessible way to create QR codes without needing to download any software or plugins. Users can generate a QR code for any input, view it on the page, and access a scrollable history of their most recent codes.

API interaction: Leveraging a public QR code generation API to handle real-time image rendering.

Clean UI/UX: Intuitive and responsive layout that works well on desktop and mobile.

Frontend functionality: Asynchronous code using fetch and async/await, dynamic DOM manipulation, and client-side data storage.

Itâ€™s a simple, yet practical application that demonstrates the essentials of building real-world single-page apps: connecting to external services, handling user input, persisting data locally, and providing a seamless user experience.
